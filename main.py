"""
main.py

Main entry point for CrossViewID Multi-Camera Player Tracking.

This script orchestrates the detection, tracking, and cross-view matching of players in synchronized sports videos (e.g., broadcast and tacticam). It loads the YOLO model, runs detection on both videos, tracks players in each view, matches players across views, and saves the results to a JSON file.

Functions:
    check_requirements: Ensure all required model and video files are present.
    setup_environment: Prepare output directory and device configuration.
    run_detection_pipeline: Run player detection on both videos.
    run_tracking_pipeline: Track players in each video.
    run_matching_pipeline: Match player tracks across camera views.
    display_results: Print summary of results to the console.
    save_results: Save results and statistics to a JSON file.
    main: Main workflow for the pipeline.
